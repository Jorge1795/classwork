  <h2 id="">Activist</h2> </center>
  
  <center><p>When I hear the word activist I think about Rosa Parks why? Because she fought for her rights,<br> 
      she always spoke and never backed up because of the situation. To me an activist are people who just<br>
	  want to be heard, people who fight for what they believe in now there are some acgtivist that cause <br>
	  trouble and believe in doing wrong but when I think of an activist I think of a person who just wants<br>
	   what they deserve.</p>

    <h2 id="upper1">Upper Class</h2>
	
	<p>When I think of the word upper class I see beautiful women and expensive cars. I also think <br>
	that moast rich people are selfish. They dont like to share or even pay taxes like Trump, <br>
	Trump hasnt paid taxes in so many years and he thinks that that makeshim smart but just <br>
	just makeshim selfish now I know that not all wealthy people are like this because i know<br>
	some wealthy people that are not like that. </p>

      <h2>Lesbian</h2>
	   <p>Lesbians make me think of two beautiful college teen girls making out and being so girly,<br>
	   a girl that just loves to have fun. So what I thought was a lesbian is wrong it doesnt have <br>
	   to be a young college girl or girly. From what I see a 43 year old mother thats married and <br>
	   has kids which does not know ifshe should tell people just because she doesnt know how <br>people will
	   treat her and if shes even safe being a lesbian.</p>

	     <h2>Gay</h2>
	      <p>When I think of gay I think of some guy that is alway happy no matter what,<br> 
		  a guy that will make you smile when you're upset. I have nothing agaisnt it<br>
		  but me being who I am I think that its not right, I believe in a man and a <br>
		  woman thats what I was tought and what right. The U.S has been doing<br>
	      some crazy things over the time things that are not right. But I see that<br>
		  not all people are happy because they don't know how others will treat <br>
		  them which is not right but like I said I don't have anything against gay<br> people I don't think it's right</p>

	     <h2>Convict</h2>
		  <p>When I think of the word convict I think of guns I think of a person that<br>
		  has no heart for another person a person that most likely has tattos all over <br>
		  their body. Yes I know that not all convicts are terrible people but lets be <br>
		  honest when you hear the word convict you imagine someone dangerous<br> 
		  someone that is not a good person. </p>

	         <h2>Alcoholic</h2>
	           <p>When I hear the word alcoholic I think of a guy that drinks too much, <br>
							 a person that's lazy and never gets anything done, a person that doesnt<br>
							  take full responsibility of their actions. I mean i'm sure they think that<br>
								 they have areason to drink too much but I really think that theres never <br>
								 a good reason to why hurt your OWN body. But I do feel bad for the people who <br>
								 are peer presured into drinking like you dont need to drink so much to the point <br>
								 that you can't even walk yo can hurt other people and hurt ypurself. </p>

				  <h2>HIV+</h2>
					<p>The reason my picture has a group of people is because<br>
					 any guy or girl can can get infected with Hiv. A virgin can get infected <br>
					 you don't have to be sleeping around to get infected with Hiv, a mosquito</p>

      <h2>Working class</h2>
			 <p>To me working class are the type of people that really work for what they have,<br>
			  people who work hard for their families. I didn't really know how hard they worked<br>
				 until this past summer when i worked in construction I had a first row seat, I saw <br>
				 how the people who work there work really hard. These people sometimes only have <br>
				 enough to feed their kids and pay the bills </p>  </center>

				<h2>n   /??????????????????Deaf</h2>
				 <p>To me when I think of a person thats deaf I mainly think of older people I think of <br>
